# Design Patterns in Python

The Design Patterns illustrated and implemented in this repository come from the [*Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable
Object Oriented Software*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) book, written by written by Erich Gamma,
Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, a.k.a. The Gang of Four (GoF).

I hope the implementations are clear enough to be re-implemented in any other programming language.

As a side note: this is still work in progress. I will start implementing the patterns I either like most or have used
more often throughout my career.
